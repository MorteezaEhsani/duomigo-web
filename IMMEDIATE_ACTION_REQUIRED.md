# üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - Clerk Custom Domain Issue

## The Problem
Clerk is trying to load from `clerk.duomigo.com` which has SSL errors.
This is happening because either:
1. Your Vercel has a hidden `CLERK_DOMAIN` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_DOMAIN` variable
2. Your Clerk Dashboard has custom domains configured

## ACTION 1: Check Vercel Environment Variables (CRITICAL!)

Go to: **Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí duomigo-web ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**

**LOOK FOR AND DELETE** any of these:
- `CLERK_DOMAIN`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_DOMAIN`
- `CLERK_FRONTEND_API`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API`
- `CLERK_JS_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_JS_URL`

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Sometimes these are hidden in different sections:
- Check "Production" tab
- Check "Preview" tab
- Check "Development" tab
- Use the search box to search for "CLERK"

## ACTION 2: Check Clerk Dashboard

1. Go to: https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. Select your production instance
3. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Domains**
4. **REMOVE/DISABLE** any custom domains:
   - Remove `clerk.duomigo.com`
   - Remove `accounts.duomigo.com`
   - Click "Remove" or "Disable" on any custom domain

## ACTION 3: Force Default Domain in Vercel

Add this NEW environment variable to force the default domain:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_DOMAIN=ins-338vusC4LuNLCnBiZrXZhdtKXrw.clerk.accounts.dev
```

Wait, NO! Don't add that. Instead, make sure NO domain variables exist at all.

## ACTION 4: Check for Hidden Configurations

In Vercel, also check:
1. **Project Settings ‚Üí Functions** - Look for any environment variables there
2. **Project Settings ‚Üí General** - Check for any overrides
3. **Team Settings** - If you're on a team, check team-level env vars

## ACTION 5: Nuclear Option - Clear Everything

If still not working:
1. In Vercel, DELETE ALL Clerk environment variables
2. Re-add ONLY these:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[your pk_live key]
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=[your sk_live key]
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/app
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/app
```
3. Redeploy WITHOUT cache

## The Error Shows:
```
clerk.duomigo.com/npm/@clerk/clerk-js@5/dist/clerk.browser.js:1
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH
```

This means Clerk IS configured to use `clerk.duomigo.com` somewhere!

## Check Your Publishable Key

Your publishable key might be from an instance that has custom domains hardcoded.

Try this:
1. In Clerk Dashboard, go to API Keys
2. Check if there's a note about custom domains
3. Consider generating new API keys if the current ones are tied to custom domains

## Last Resort

If nothing works, create a NEW Clerk application:
1. Create new Clerk app
2. Get new publishable and secret keys
3. Update Vercel with new keys
4. This will definitely not have custom domains
